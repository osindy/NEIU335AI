# CS 335: Artificial Intelligence (Spring 2026)

## COURSE INFORMATION

**Credit Hours:** 3

**Course Description:**
This course covers strong artificial intelligence methods, which have resulted in the development of systems that solve open problems in specialized domains. Such methods include 1) AI models based on logical reasoning, in particular decision trees and learning decision trees, rule-based expert systems, semantic nets, and frames; 2) AI models based on probabilistic reasoning, in particular Bayesian networks and learning Bayesian networks, influence diagrams, and class probability trees; and 3) AI models based on emergent intelligence, in particular evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence. Lastly, the course discusses an important endeavor in AI, namely, language processing.

**Course Prerequisites:** CS-201, minimum grade of ’C’, and CS-207, minimum grade of C.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES / YOUR LEARNING OUTCOMES

- You will be able to understand what artificial intelligence (AI) is, including its history, core concepts, and modern applications.
- You can apply machine learning concepts such as supervised learning, training vs. testing data, and model evaluation.
- You can perform basic natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including tokenization, sentiment analysis, and text classification.
- Using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, you can build a chatbot that integrates information retrieval with text generation.
- You can collaborate with others using version control tools like GitHub and follow development best practices in AI projects.

## YOUR TASKS / ASSIGNMENTS / REQUIREMENTS

**LinkedIn & GitHub**
As we delve into today's professional landscape, it's paramount to recognize the significance of a strong LinkedIn presence to showcase your work to potential recruiters and employers. Creating a strong GitHub profile is equally important, if not more important.

**1:1 Meetings:**
As you embark on your professional careers, engaging in regular meetings with your supervisor/manager, known as 1:1 or one-on-one meetings, is a common practice. To prepare you for these types of meetings, I will provide opportunities for us to meet one-on-one before the end of week 5 of the course.

**Labs**
Throughout the semester, there are a few labs to test your knowledge of key concepts. These labs are meant to serve as additional practice for the hands-on work we do in class.

**Group Chatbot Project**
In this final project, you will apply your understanding of AI, NLP, and retrieval techniques to build a functional AI-powered chatbot. Rather than relying on a general internet-trained model, your chatbot can answer questions using a knowledge base you create yourself, turning your curated content into a searchable, intelligent assistant. Over the second half of the course, you will design, prototype, and deploy this chatbot by combining embedding models, vector search, and language model prompting, following the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Your final deliverable will be a working chatbot, a short presentation, and clean, well-documented code.

**Quizzes & Final Exam**
There will be four (4) quizzes throughout the semester to test your knowledge of the course material. The lowest quiz will be dropped at the end of the semester.

**Extra Credit:**
**Guest Speakers:**
The industry-leading professionals' guest speaking opportunities can provide valuable insights and knowledge that can be applied in your future career. Guest speakers will be conducted where professionals from the fields of computer science, project management, AI/ML, and business will come to class to provide valuable insights about their experiences and advice.

**COBT Mission Statement**
The College of Business and Management provides quality and accessible undergraduate and graduate education in business to a diverse student population from metropolitan Chicago and beyond. We prepare students for professional careers in an increasingly multicultural and global business environment. The college emphasizes teaching and learning through a variety of teaching methods, research (primarily applied and pedagogical), and service.

**AI Policy:**
The recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled generating images, coherent text, and music with minimal or without human intervention. While the results are fascinating, generative AI models suffer from hallucination, the inability to take into account recent information, mimicking behavior from the training dataset, and the failure to reason, among other critical issues. It is, therefore, essential to identify tasks you may or may not use generative AI to perform. You may use generative AI tools to generate ideas, provide suggestions on the structure of your work, and survey existing research in a particular field. You must explicitly cite the tool used to perform the above mentioned tasks. However, any submitted work must be your own, and you must not use generative AI tools to write a part or the whole of the submitted work. Any violation of these rules will be considered plagiarism.
